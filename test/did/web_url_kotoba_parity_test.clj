;; `kotoba/did/web_url.kotoba` against `did.core/did-web-url`.
;;
;; Two things are tested here and the file keeps them apart, as
;; `org-ietf-oauth2`'s does.
;;
;; **Parity** covers the shapes the library already gets right: a bare host,
;; and a host with path segments. The guest must produce the same URL.
;;
;; **The refusals have no oracle**, because the library does not make them.
;; Measured on this repo at accf098:
;;
;;   did:web:example.com:..:..:etc:passwd
;;     -> https://example.com/../../etc/passwd/did.json
;;   did:web:example.com::alice
;;     -> https://example.com//alice/did.json
;;   did:web:example.com%3A3000
;;     -> https://example.com%3A3000/.well-known/did.json
;;
;; Those are asserted directly against the guest and against the recorded
;; behaviour of the oracle, so the difference is visible rather than
;; implied. `.cljc` did not grow a second copy of the refusals: a check
;; implemented twice is a check that will diverge once (ADR-2608261100).
;;
;; ## The negative controls
;;
;; Each is a URL that gets FETCHED, which is what makes them worth a test
;; rather than a comment:
;;
;;   * `path-traversal-is-refused` — `..` climbs out of the path the DID
;;     named, so the resolver fetches a document the DID does not identify;
;;   * `an-empty-segment-is-refused` — `//` in a path is not the path the
;;     author wrote;
;;   * `a-percent-encoded-colon-is-a-port` — the method spec's one meaning
;;     for percent-encoding, and leaving it encoded produces a host no
;;     resolver reaches;
;;   * `an-unrecognised-escape-is-refused-not-forwarded` — forwarding an
;;     escape you do not understand decides, by omission, that whatever the
;;     HTTP client makes of it is fine;
;;   * `a-refused-did-yields-no-url` — the URL is the thing that gets
;;     fetched; handing one back from a refusal makes the refusal
;;     decorative.
